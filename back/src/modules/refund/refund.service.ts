  //     has resolved successfully (or wasn't needed at all — cash, or a $0
  //     refund skip the call entirely, both below).
  //  2. Of the two local writes that follow, the subscription is saved
  //     BEFORE the payment. See the comment at that line for why that
  //     order — not the more "obvious" payment-first one — is the safer
  //     partial-failure mode.
